    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When dinner is a race against the clock, shrimp is your greatest ally. For this skillet dinner, quickly sear shrimp until tender and pink, then toss with a glossy, caramelized honey-garlic glaze. It’s perfect for serving over steamed rice or with a crisp cucumber salad. 

    Because this recipe requires just five ingredients (plus the olive oil, salt, and pepper sitting by your stovetop) and about 10 minutes, you’ll be sitting down at the table in no time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound raw large shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley leaves, for garnish </li>(optional)
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If needed, peel and devein 1 pound raw large shrimp (you can leave the tails on or remove them). Pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>

        <li>Cut 1/2 medium lemon into wedges and reserve for serving. Juice the remaining 1/2 medium lemon until you have 1 tablespoon and place in a small bowl. Grate 4 garlic cloves on a Microplane or mince. Add the garlic, 1/4 cup honey, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the lemon juice. Whisk until the honey is dissolved.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook until they start to curl, turn pink, and are just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.</li>

        <li>Add the sauce to the skillet and cook until thickened and reduced by about half, 2 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat. Return the shrimp to the skillet (leave any liquid on the plate), and toss to coat in the glaze. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley leaves if desired and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
